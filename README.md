# SocialNetwork-ASP.NET-WebAPI2-Angular2-Bootstrap3-Tokens

Tiny Social Network with Angular 2 Bootstrap 3 on ASP.NET WebAPI MVC 5 and tokens authorization

Made as result of playing with rxjs on angular 2.
All frontend made of reactive streams.

For all actions user must be authorized.User can add as friend another user and if they are both added as friends they can chat in real time.

Further updates will bring conferences and UX improvements and of course bug fixes.MANY bug fixes =) cheers.

Initial prototype with backend and frontend can:

1. add users as friends 
2. stores chat conversations
3. Autocomplete search
4. real time chatting
5. number of unread messages tracking
6. registration and authorization
